        <h2>Image</h2>
        <p>
An image is a visual representation or depiction of an object, scene, person, or concept. In the context of digital technology, an image is often a two-dimensional array of pixels, where each pixel represents a tiny unit of color or grayscale value. Images can be created using various methods, such as photography, painting, drawing, or digital design.

Digital images are commonly used in computer graphics, multimedia, and various forms of media. They can be stored and transmitted in different file formats, such as JPEG, PNG, GIF, and others. Images play a crucial role in communication, art, science, and many other fields.</p>

            Vector Images:
            
            SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics): Based on XML, SVG is a vector image format that is scalable without loss of quality. It's commonly used for web graphics.
            Digital Photographs:
            
            Images captured by digital cameras. They are often stored in formats like JPEG.</p>

        <h2>Hosting</h2>
        <p>Hosting refers to the process of storing, serving, and managing files, data, or content for a website or application on a server. When you create a website or web application, the files that make up your site (such as HTML, CSS, images, and other media files) need to be stored on a server so that they can be accessed by users over the internet</p>
        <p>Web Hosting:

    <p>Types of Hosting:

        Shared Hosting: Multiple websites share resources on a single server. It is cost-effective but may have limitations in terms of performance and resources.
        Virtual Private Server (VPS) Hosting: A virtualized server environment where multiple virtual servers coexist on a single physical server. Each virtual server has its own dedicated resources.
        Dedicated Hosting: A single server is dedicated to a single user or organization, providing maximum control and resources.
        Cloud Hosting: Resources are distributed across multiple servers, providing scalability and flexibility. Users pay for the resources they consume.</p>
